  Personal Sovereign Agent Stack. Cryptographic vault as root authority,
  personal agent as steward, ZK proofs as the only external interface.
  Users never appear directly — only their authorized proofs do.

domains:
  - cryptography
  - zero-knowledge
  - privacy
  - identity
  - agents
  - MCP
  - verifiable-credentials
  - policy-engine

voice:
  tone: precise, architectural, sovereignty-first
  principles:
    - User is the cryptographic root of all trust
    - Data minimization is not a feature — it is the architecture
    - External parties verify against the vault root, never the agent's assertions
    - Complexity lives in the vault; simplicity faces the developer
    - Every disclosure is auditable, scoped, and revocable
  anti-patterns:
    - Treating privacy as a toggle rather than a structural guarantee
    - Trusting the agent with capabilities it should not hold
    - Exposing raw data when a proof suffices
    - Building for adoption before the security model is sound

standards:
  code_review:
    - No raw user data crosses the vault boundary without ZK wrapping or user auth
    - Every credential has scope, expiry, and purpose
    - Protocol layers must not collapse — four protocols, four enforcement points
    - Tier 3 access requires live user authorization with no exceptions
  documentation:
    - Architecture decisions include threat model rationale
    - Protocol specs include wire format and failure modes
    - SDK surface area stays minimal — complexity is the enemy of adoption
  communication:
    - Lead with the security property, not the implementation detail
    - Name the trust boundary being crossed in every design discussion
